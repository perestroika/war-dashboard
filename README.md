<h1 align="center">War Dashboard</h1>


During my studies at the Web School Factory, I had the project to create a dashboard.   
The subject as well as the technologies were free to choose.

At first, I wanted to make a dashboard on war data, however, there was a lot of information and I preferred to focus on a specific part, namely, the violence against civilians.



## Quick start

> $ npm install

<div></div>

> $ npm start


## What's included


```text
Civilians Dashboard/
└── node_modules/
└── public/
└── src/
    ├── assets/
    └── components/
       └── country-charts
       └── dashboard-charts   
```

## Stack

For the technical stack, React was chosen to create the dashboard.  
Why React ? The creation of a SPA is a wise choice to display data because it is very fast.

React was used in conjunction with TailwindCSS and ApexCharts.

## Data source

The data set is from the Uppsala program (Uppsala Conflict Data Program).  
The dataset used is the following one: UCDP One-sided Violence Dataset version 20.1
